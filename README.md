    i don't accept random friend reqs, i only accept them if we've talked at least once. the only time i'll accept them out of the blue is if you're a friend of a friend or it's to send me a link, an emergency, etc.

    please don't expect me to be able to hold conversations for very long. or like, at all, it's my one true weakness and something i think i'll always struggle with. forgive me.

    it takes me a while to be comfortable around people and even longer to really befriend them, i'm not always gonna want to be AROUND you. so if i end up not replying, don't take it personally. i just aint up for it that day. i'm veryyy seletcive and private with a bunch of walls built up, it takes awhile for me to rreallyy trust people.
