    i don't accept random friend reqs, i only accept them if we've talked at least once. the only time i'll accept them out of the blue is if you're a friend of a friend or it's to send me a link, an emergency, etc.

    please don't expect me to be able to hold conversations for very long. or like, at all, it's my one true weakness and something i think i'll always struggle with. forgive me.

    it takes me a while to be comfortable around people and even longer to really befriend them, i'm not always gonna want to be AROUND you. so if i end up not replying, don't take it personally. i just aint up for it that day. i'm veryyy seletcive and private with a bunch of walls built up, it takes awhile for me to rreallyy trust people. i also read into everything and overthink, blah blah blah. i purposely exclude myself, yada yada.

    if i don't have "c+h" in my name, ask before you just do so. i just need a warning before i'm approached and sat with out of the blue.

    <b> i do not care about any online discourse </b> or whatever pissing contest is brewing around me, i'm apathetic to it, if it's not hurting anyone/anything i dont really care. i just report, block, and move on with my life. c'est la vie.
